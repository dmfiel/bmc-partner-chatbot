## Overview

### The challenge

The BMC reseller team wanted to avoid routine questions from their partners along with showcasing BMC solutions. So, we built a chatbot providing easy access to frequently asked questions available to them exclusively in the private solution partner portal. Using input from the partner managers, we assembled a large list of routine questions and answers. We then crafted custom entities, intents, and keywords in IBM Watson so that it could properly identify the partners' needs and provide appropriate answers. Besides assembling the FAQ data, the biggest challenge in working with the chatbot system was formatting the responses well, since Watson supports a very limited set of HTML markup and the rendering was different between the native Watson Chatbot and the interface of Helix Virtual Agent.
